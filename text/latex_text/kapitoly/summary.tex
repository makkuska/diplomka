The main goal of this thesis is to evaluate options of replication
solutions which are available and based on this research design a database solution which
considers possibilities and requirements of the Department of
Geoinformatics. In the theoretical part terms replication,
synchronization and versioning are defined including description of
synchronous, asynchronous, master-slave, multimaster, cascade, logical and
physical replication. The requirements of ArcGIS products for storage of data
in database were considered and ArcSDE Technology which is used by ArcGIS products
for database storage of spatial data was described. 

Based on the research database management system PostgreSQL was chosen because
it is supported by ArcGIS products. The design of the database solution was
created based on all requirements and the main processes were tested. Based on
that a manual of the proposed replication solution setup was written. Two 
replication options were tested - PostgreSQL native streaming replication
and replication using PostgreSQL extension Slony-I. The design includes a description of usage of pgpool utility used for
load-balancing.
